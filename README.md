This project implements a program to compute the convex hull of a set of points in a 2D plane. It defines a Point class with methods for distance calculation, equality checks, and comparisons, alongside functions to determine the convex hull and its area. The program reads input points, calculates the convex hull using the Monotone Chain algorithm, and outputs both the vertices of the hull and its area, ensuring robust performance through test cases.
